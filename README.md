OpenPort80 using ASR Recovery plans
===================================

            

 

 

 


This runbook is a sample script to accompany the article Add Azure automation runbooks to recovery plans. The article is at https://azue.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/site-recovery-runbook-automation.


 


This is just a sample script. After you import the script via the gallery into Azure automation, you can change the script and its variables to suit your needs.


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
